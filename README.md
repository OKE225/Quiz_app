This is a **MERN stack web application** that presents a single question with four possible answers. After completing the quiz, the user sees a summary with their results. The **site is fully responsive** and offers a clean, simple, and modern user interface

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, which together create a visually appealing and **user-friendly design** that works well on all devices. **Dark mode is automatically enabled based on the user's system preferences** to provide a comfortable viewing experience

On the backend, the app uses Node.js and Express.js, while data is securely stored and managed on an external MongoDB server, ensuring scalable and reliable performance
